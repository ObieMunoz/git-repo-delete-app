# Repository Deletion App

After attending the Flatiron School's Software Engineering program, I had hundreds of Github repositories that were related to the course and I wanted an easy way to delete them. This application was the result of that thought process.

To use this, you will have to obtain a developer personal access token for your github account that has delete repo access.

You can only delete public repositories using this application.
